# TextPCG
A procedurally generated text adventure, which gives the player the ability to make their own scenario each game.

This project aims to create a text-based adventure game in the vein of Zelda that is played like a roguelike. The stories will likely be pretty linear, going from Point A -> B -> C -> B -> D -> E, etc. However, more open scenarios are on the table as well.

The main pull of this game will be that it will be procedurally generated from a collection of cards that the player has. Credit for this idea (and likely many of the ideas that will be implemented) goes to Sean Howard of Squidi.net.

The player will get loot throughout the game like a normal adventure game, but sometimes that loot will be accompanied by cards that allow the user to play a meta-game: craft your next game using your favorite dungeons, monsters, enemies, towns, and items by collecting cards that coorespond to them.
